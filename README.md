‚ö° Lightning Node Project Summary
‚úÖ Goal:
Run a Bitcoin + Lightning Network node on SBC hardware (currently LeefBox with Armbian) to potentially earn routing fees and learn the Lightning ecosystem.

üñ•Ô∏è Current Setup:
Component	Status
Hardware	LeefBox (RK322x-based), Armbian
Bitcoin Core	‚úÖ Compiled (v26.0), syncing blockchain (pruned mode, last ~30 days)
Core Lightning (CLN)	‚úÖ Compiled (v25.02.2), running, connected to Bitcoin Core
Configurations	Matching rpcuser / rpcpassword ‚úî
Logs	Bitcoin: ~/.bitcoin/debug.log
CLN: Custom log file via --log-file
Backup Plan	NAND backup planned before hardware transfer to M9S Pro

‚öôÔ∏è Next Planned Steps:
Finish Bitcoin Core sync

Generate Bitcoin address for funding Lightning wallet

Connect to peers

Open Lightning channels

Begin routing transactions ‚Üí potential to earn fees over time

Monitor node performance and possibly advertise node for routing traffic

üìù Optional Future Enhancements:
Migrate setup to M9S Pro (with NAND backup/fallback plan)

Automate with systemd services for autostart

Set up external backups for wallet data

Add Tor for privacy

Use Amboss or 1ML to list node publicly if desired
